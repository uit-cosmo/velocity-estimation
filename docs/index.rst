Velocity estimation
===================================

**velocity_estimation** is a Python library implementing the three-point velocity estimation technique described `here <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0197251>`.
This technique is tailored for coarse-grained imaging data, and has been applied to avalanche photodiode gass-puff imaging and synthetic data.
