.. _velocity_estimation-synthetic_data:

Example
===============

In this page we provide a full example of the usage of the method and its interfaces. Since actual data
from experiments requires a collaboration agreement, we will employ synthetic data generated with the
package `blobmodel`. We will not explain how to generate the data here, for that we refer to the documentation
of `blobmodel`.
